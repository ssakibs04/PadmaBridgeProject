# PadmaBridgeProject
DisclaimerThe following scenario is totally imaginary. It has nothing to do with real PadmaBridge project.Suppose the Bangladesh Bridge Authority has proposed to setup Padma Bridge toll-box at the end ofDhaka-Mawa  highway.  To  store  and  manage  daily  tolls  and  transactions  they  want  to  install  asoftware system. A part of that software will be implemented by you. The partial requirement is kindof following.The toll-box will have 3 counters for 3 different types of vehicles (Heavy-duty, Medium-duty, Light-duty). Each counter will serve the vehicle based on first come first serve. The vehicles will maintaina line before each counter. When a vehicle appears in a specific counter, the person sitting in thecounter will give the ticket to the driver and take the toll from the driver. The person will store theinformation  (date,  car  number,  ticket  number)  of  toll  in  the  system.  There  is  a  feature  in  the systemwhich will take the car number and give the information of the date and ticket number. There is alsoa feature in the system to calculate total earning of the day of individual counters and total earningsof all counters. Suppose the toll rates for different vehicle types are givenbelow.
